# Customer Segmentation Using KMeans

# Overview

This project implements a K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. It provides insights into customer behavior that can help businesses in targeted marketing strategies.

# Problem Statement

Create a K-Means clustering model to segment customers based on features such as age, annual income, and spending score. The goal is to identify patterns and group customers into distinct clusters.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle:
Customer Segmentation Dataset

# Steps Involved

# Data Preprocessing:
Loading the dataset.
Cleaning data.
Exploring and visualizing the features.

# Feature Engineering:
Selecting relevant features for clustering: Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.

# Clustering with K-Means:
Using the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Applying K-Means clustering to the selected features.

# Visualization:
Plotting clusters to understand customer segmentation visually.
Using 2D and 3D visualizations for enhanced interpretability.

# Analysis:
Interpreting the clusters to identify customer personas.
Requirements

# Python (3.11)
# Libraries:
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Plotly
How to Run

# The project includes:

Distribution plots for each feature.
Scatter plots to understand feature relationships.
Cluster visualizations in both 2D and 3D.

# Results

The project outputs customer clusters based on the input features. These clusters can be analyzed for strategic decision-making, such as targeted advertising or customer retention programs.
